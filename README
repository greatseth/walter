= Walter

Walter is a web app you run locally. It's a "git browser" of sorts. Think GitNub or GitX but with more awesome included.

It's early, yet, so I'm not going to fret examples and promises too much.. so, stay tuned!

== Basic Usage

  $ cd /some/project
  $ walt
  
LOST fans will the alternative startup command:

  $ cd /some/project
  $ waaaaaaaaalt

== Requirements

I recommend Ruby 1.9.1, but try whatever you got, and let me know..
